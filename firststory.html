                <p class="story1">Last Monday, the 23rd, local Canuck Scott Hawkins had yet another breakdown in class. In the middle of our English class, Scott decided to produce a bar of soap from his pockets, and to eat it. The laughter generated by this event caused the rest of the class to get startled heavily.<br><br>

So, it was English class, 5th period. We were going over gothic conventions and watching some movie trailers. After getting through the first two, we arrived at Batman Returns. Due to the fact that Danny DeVito was starring as the Penguin, and as we are all so infatuated with the man, a chorus of shouting and laughing broke out when his name flashed on screen. Then, we got surprised again when Batman just kind of tips off of a building, instead of just jumping. Because of this good mood towards the end, we all looked to Scott to produce another scene.<br><br>

After the end of the trailer, Scott produced a bar of soap from his pocket. Now, to understand this inside joke takes us back to term 2, and the science room. During a dissection, we had to clean our hands, and Scott stole all of the soap bars. Scott then proceeded through the following weeks to break the soap in half, to throw it at us, and just to have a joke. The soap then started to symbolize Scott’s antics, and whenever it was produced we would all laugh. This is one of many in-jokes in our friend group.<br><br>

So, when Scott brought out the soap, we all knew something would happen. And we all knew that it would be hilarious. Scott grabbed it, brought it to his mouth, smiled at us, and then bit down on a corner of the soap. The reactions were instant. Bits of soap fell everywhere, and as I sit here now and type this, it still has not been fully cleaned. We all nearly died of laughter, as none of us had expected it to go this far.<br><br>

The teacher, Ms. Salisbury, has bemused as to what had caused all the noise, and a hilarious back and forth from Scott and the Teacher ensued. Ms. Salisbury never ended up knowing what happened. After being questioned about it, Scott simply said ‘It’s hygienic’.  Scott is known for things like this, and one can only wonder what drives him to do it.<br><br>
